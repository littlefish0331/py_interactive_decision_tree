# decision-tree-vis

The `dtvis` library offers interactive visualization of Scikit-learn DecisionTreeClassifier in a Jupyter Notebook or in a browser window. The library is currently under development but most functionality is already implemented.

The codebook that describes the variables of the dataset and variable encodings can be found in the references folder.

The dataset used here can be downloaded from [this link](https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/share/HAfuNnNSbFqKmdyuodrVAQMpgcyqoFACuBoKWIqoWeG/folder/k68TM2nPRy6XHf9GrpSh3Q/TCdP3ychSD29ji2suo7FOA?_encoding=UTF8&mgh=1&ref_=cd_ph_share_link_copy).
